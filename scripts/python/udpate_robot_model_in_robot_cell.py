# TODO load the robot cell from URDF and SRDF, load the robot cell and cell state from JSON files, and then update the robot model in the robot cell, delete all robot_conf in the robot cell state (bc robot model changes, conf is not meaningful anymore), but keep the grasp and robot base frame

# This allows us to update robot model easily without having to launch Rhino.
